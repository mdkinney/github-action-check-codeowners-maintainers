Code Contributions
------------------

To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.

#. Create a change description in the format specified below to
    use in the source control commit log.
#. Your commit message must include your ``Signed-off-by`` signature
#. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
    that the project documents on its web page. If the process is
    not documented, then submit the code on development email list
    for the project.
#. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
    copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
    then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:

-  BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
-  BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
-  MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

-  Zlib: http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib

For documentation:

-  FreeBSD Documentation License
    https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html

Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be accepted.

Contributions using other licenses might be accepted, but further
review will be required.

Developer Certificate of Origin
-------------------------------

Your change description should use the standard format for a
commit message, and must include your ``Signed-off-by`` signature.

In order to keep track of who did what, all patches contributed must
include a statement that to the best of the contributor's knowledge
they have the right to contribute it under the specified license.

The test for this is as specified in the `Developer's Certificate of
Origin (DCO) 1.1 <https://developercertificate.org/>`__. The contributor
certifies compliance by adding a line saying

Signed-off-by: Developer Name developer@example.org

where ``Developer Name`` is the contributor's real name, and the email
address is one the developer is reachable through at the time of
contributing.

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

        this project or the open source license(s) involved.
